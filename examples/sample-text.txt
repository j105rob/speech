Welcome to the AWS Polly SSML Toolkit! This is a demonstration of loading plain text from a file and converting it to speech. The toolkit automatically detects whether your file contains plain text or SSML markup, and handles the conversion appropriately.

This text will be automatically escaped and wrapped in SSML tags, making it safe for speech synthesis. You can include special characters like & < > " ' and they will be properly handled.

Thank you for using our speech synthesis toolkit!
